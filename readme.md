# Titanic: Machine Learning From Disaster: Project Overview 


## Resources
**R Version:** 4.1.0  
**Packages:** ggplot2, dplyr, magrittr, DataExplorer, funModeling, aod  
**OS:** macOS 12.2.1  
**Other Resources:** https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/dae/logit-regression/  

## Objectives
*   Explore practices of EDA for feature selection/machine learning.
*   Exercise good statistical fundamentals.
*   Gain a working understanding of the data available for training.
*   Prepare to train and compare multiple models.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
I explored the data in the following ways to gain information for feature selection:

*   Examined column names, lengths, general size/shape of data.
*   Profiled percentage of missing values for each column.
*   Examined summary statistics and distributions for each column.
*   Examined relationships between columns with tables and 
*   Performed logistic (binomial logit) regression to explore relationships between my target variable (Survived) and factor columns.
*   Interpreted logit regression results with 95% confidence intervals and Wald tests.
